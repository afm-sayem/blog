    <p>Around late 2012, I suffered a shoulder injury while playing badminton that later turned into chronic pain. Several physiotherapy sessions resulted in improvements but I was not able to sit before a computer for prolonged sessions.</p>
<p>I was reading up on ergonomic keyboards, sitting arrangements, and posture all day to find something that would relieve me of the pain. I bought a better keyboard. Taught myself how to sit in a better posture.</p>
<p>I also became aware of RSI at that time. I discovered how common it was among programmers in general.</p>
<p>After much studying, I decided to teach myself Dvorak.</p>
<p>Switching keyboard layout was one of the hardest things I had to teach myself. The first few days, my head and hands were in constant battle. It&rsquo;s difficult to change habits. It&rsquo;s way harder if the habit had turned into instinct. QWERTY had become a part of my instinct.</p>
<p>After a painful couple of months, I was at my regular speed. Now it&rsquo;s been a couple of years and while it&rsquo;s a matter of opinion, I think Dvorak is much more comfortable to type on than QWERTY.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2014, I wanted to try a better editor. Around that time text editor churn was extremely fast. We had Brackets from Adobe, Atom from Github, Lighttable, Sublime Text, and a new one coming every day. What could be a tool that I can keep using for the next 20 years? The common answers on online forums were two, Vim or Emacs. I went with Vim because I liked its idea of modal editing.</p>
<p>Learning Vim took some patience. I tried several times but had to switch back to Sublime Text because the productivity drop was noticeable. Vim&rsquo;s layout is such that it&rsquo;s made for QWERTY typists. &ldquo;hjkl&rdquo; is used for navigation. But luckily, Dvorak&rsquo;s layout works surprisingly well with Vim. In QWERTY, you have to navigate using one hand but in Dvorak, you&rsquo;ll be using both of your hands to navigate which is much better and intuitive. The keys are also in very sensible positions.</p>
<p>After using Vim for a year, I understand why there&rsquo;s so much talk about it. It&rsquo;s an editor unlike any other. I think a lot of software design could benefit from the principles of Vim, to let the users express themselves and trust them with more power.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t taught yourself how to type yet, you need to know the <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">programming&rsquo;s dirty little secret</a>.</p>
